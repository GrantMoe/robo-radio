# Robo Radio (BLE)
Using Bluefruit Feathers to control a ground robot

Background
----------
I broke the 2.4 ghz RC radio I that came with the RC car I'm using as my robot's base.

I happened to have two Adafruit BLE Feather boards sitting around.

I intend to replace the broken radio board in the transmistter while retaining the preexisting switches/pots/etc.
